/**
 * The Inventory module's backend contract — `stockmovements`, `productbatches`
 * and the product fields the stock screens read.
 *
 * Kept in sync with PawCRM-Backend by hand, the same rule `types/api.ts`
 * follows. Three things here are NOT arbitrary and must not be "simplified":
 *
 *  1. QUANTITIES AND MONEY ARE STRINGS. The backend stores Decimal128 and
 *     renders decimal strings on the wire ("150000.0000"), never JSON numbers,
 *     because `JSON.parse("199999.99")` is already not 199999.99 before any of
 *     our code runs. Typing these as `number` here would reintroduce exactly the
 *     float error the backend went to some trouble to remove. Parse late, at the
 *     point of display or arithmetic, never at the type boundary.
 *  2. THE SIGN IS THE DIRECTION. `qty` is positive for goods in and negative for
 *     goods out. There is no separate direction field.
 *  3. ONE REQUEST CAN PRODUCE MANY MOVEMENTS. Creating a movement returns an
 *     ARRAY: a withdrawal spanning three lots writes three rows, a transfer
 *     writes at least two. A caller that assumed a single object would silently
 *     drop the rest.
